      <h2>My Campus Life</h2>
      <p>
        Studying at UTHM has been an exciting and unforgettable experience.  
        From attending hackathons to hanging out with friends after class, every moment is packed with learning and laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve joined several FSKTM events, workshops, and industrial visits that inspired me to improve as a developer.  
        Outside of class, I love taking pictures around campus and chilling at the café with my teammates after coding marathons.
